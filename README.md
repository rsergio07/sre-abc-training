# SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) Process

---

## Introduction

Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is a discipline that applies software engineering principles to operations to create scalable and highly reliable systems. The SRE process focuses on balancing the need for reliability with the pace of innovation. This document outlines the key practices, principles, and workflows involved in the SRE process.

## Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

The **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)** is a structured approach to software development. It involves multiple phases that ensure software is designed, developed, tested, and deployed systematically. SRE plays a critical role in ensuring the reliability and scalability of the systems throughout the SDLC.

SRE integrates with SDLC during the deployment and maintenance phases, ensuring smooth releases and reliable operations post-deployment. This process involves proactive monitoring, incident management, and automation to minimize downtime and maintain high availability.

## Core Principles

SRE is guided by several core principles that shape how operations are managed:

- **Emphasize Reliability**: Ensure that systems maintain high availability and performance.

  In this session, a Kubernetes cluster can be used to run our application with 3 replicas so that if one fails, the other 2 can take over the load, thus increasing the availability of the service.

  > Apply these changes [4. Practice](./exercises/exercise4/) to achieve an infrastructure like this one:
  > 
  > <img src="exercises/exercise4/Infra.png" alt="Infra" height="150" />
  </details>

- **Use SLIs and SLOs**: Define and track Service Level Indicators (SLIs) and Service Level Objectives (SLOs) to measure reliability.
- **Blameless Postmortems**: Learn from failures without blaming individuals, focusing on how systems can be improved.
- **Automate Operations**: Use automation to reduce manual interventions and improve system scalability.

## SLIs, SLOs, SLAs, and Error Budgets

Service Level Objectives (SLOs) are key metrics that define the expected performance and availability of a service. They are derived from **Service Level Indicators (SLIs)**, which measure system behavior.

### Key Steps:

1. **Service Level Indicator (SLI)**: A metric that measures specific system performance attributes, such as latency, availability, or error rate.

2. **Service Level Objective (SLO)**: A target for acceptable performance of an SLI, e.g., 99.9% availability. SLOs aim to balance reliability and development speed.

3. **Service Level Agreement (SLA)**: A formal agreement with customers defining expected performance and penalties for unmet objectives.

4. **Error Budget**: The allowable margin for failure within an SLO, which provides flexibility for feature development without excessive risk.

          :chart_with_upwards_trend: 
          SLO´s list
      </a>
  </summary>

  > Create a list of 4 SLO´s to eventually use in the observability strategy. This is an [example](./exercises/topic0#service-level-objectives-slos). Consider adding a new SLO based on the percentile of HTTP request latencies. Percentiles are used to measure how often certain performance thresholds are met for a majority of users. For instance, a 95th percentile latency of 100ms means that 95% of requests are served within 100ms, offering a realistic view of user experience by focusing on the performance seen by the majority of requests, rather than average or extreme cases alone.

  </details>

### White-Box Monitoring and SLOs

In white-box monitoring, metrics, traces, and logs are the primary data sources for monitoring **Service Level Indicators (SLIs)**, ensuring that **Service Level Objectives (SLOs)** are met. For example:
   - **Metrics** measure uptime and latency, forming the basis for availability and performance SLOs.
   - **Traces** reveal the journey of each request, ensuring SLOs related to request latency are achieved.
   - **Logs** provide additional context for errors and anomalies, supporting SLO adherence by enabling detailed investigations when issues arise.

## Monitoring and Incident Management

Monitoring is crucial for detecting issues early and responding swiftly to incidents.

### Best Practices:
- **Set Up Monitoring Systems**: Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and OpenTelemetry provide insights into system performance using **metrics**, **traces**, and **logs**.

  In this section, a **Prometheus** server is installed on the node that will eventually be used as a repository for traces and metrics.

      </details>

- **Golden Signals**: Monitoring should focus on four critical **Golden Signals** to track the health of a service:
  
  1. **Latency**: The time it takes to service a request.
  2. **Traffic**: The amount of demand or load being placed on the system (e.g., requests per second).
  3. **Errors**: The rate of failed requests.
  4. **Saturation**: How full a service's resources are, such as CPU or memory.

  </details>
  
- **Incident Response**: When issues occur, follow a clear incident management process to resolve them quickly:
  1. **Detect the issue** using Golden Signals, monitoring, and alerting systems.
  2. **Respond to the alert** and acknowledge the incident.
  3. **Mitigate the problem** using workarounds or rollbacks to minimize customer impact.
  4. **Document the incident** for review and postmortem analysis.

  </details>

## Operational Readiness Reviews (ORR)

Operational Readiness Reviews ensure that services are ready for production deployment. ORRs evaluate the robustness of infrastructure, the maturity of monitoring, and the ability to handle failures.

### Checklist for Operational Readiness Review (ORR):
- Ensure service has monitoring and alerting in place.
- Review the capacity plan and ensure scaling capabilities.
- Confirm all dependencies are resilient to failures.
- Review disaster recovery strategies.

## Change Management and Automation

Automating repetitive tasks and following structured change management processes helps reduce risk during deployments.

### Key Automation Practices:

## Cost Optimization

SRE focuses not only on reliability but also on ensuring efficient use of resources.

### Strategies:
- **Autoscaling**: Adjust resources dynamically based on demand.
- **Capacity Planning**: Regularly review resource utilization and plan for growth.
- **Optimize Cloud Usage**: Ensure cloud services are provisioned based on actual needs.

## Continuous Improvement

SRE processes should continuously evolve based on feedback and lessons learned from incidents and performance reviews.

### Key Activities:
- **Blameless Postmortems**: Conduct post-incident reviews to identify root causes and improvements.
- **Regularly Review SLOs**: Ensure that SLOs remain aligned with business needs.
- **Invest in Tooling**: Continuously improve monitoring, alerting, and automation systems.
